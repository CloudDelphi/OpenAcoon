<h1>Download and Installation</h1>

<p>Simply download the Zip-File and unpack it into a directory of your choice. There is no installer.
It runs right from within the directory where you unpack it.</p>

<p>Open a command-prompt and change to the directory where you unpacked the files. Run "makedirs.bat". This will create
several subdirectories within your install directory that will hold all the data-files.</p>

<p>Next go to "http://www.alexa.com/topsites". On the top-right you will find a link to "Top 1,000,000 Sites". Download
that file and unpack it into the same directory where you put the other files. In the command-prompt run the command:</p>

<p><strong>ImportAlexa top-1m.csv domainrank.txt</strong></p>

<p>This will take a few seconds and will convert the file from Alexa.com into a simpler
format that the software uses as part of the result-ranking.</p>

<p>Now run the program "ImportUrls". At this point this will only create an empty URL-database.</p>

<p>You will now need some starting-points for the crawler. In the command-prompt enter the following command:</p>

<p><strong>copy domainrank.txt data\txt\urls.txt</strong></p>

<p>This will use the top 1 million sites according to Alexa.com as a starting-point for your crawl. If one million URLs
sounds like a lot to you... you ain't seen nothing yet. :)</p>

<p>Now these URLs need to be imported into the URL-database. Run "openacoon.bat". This batch-file will also later be used
when you are in the middle of a crawl to process all the data. Right now it will only import the starting URLs into the
database. The batch-file will run continuously, so you need to abort it at the right point. It will pause for 5 seconds
every pass. You will see this point when it counts down the seconds... 5...4...3...2...1... Sometime during that simply
press Ctrl-C and abort the batch-file. You should NEVER abort openacoon.bat at any other point. It may damage the
databases. That's why there is a visible countdown, so that you know when you can safely stop the batch-file.</p>

<p>You should now have about 1 million URLs in the database. So now you need to give these to the actual robot. That is
done with the program "PrepareRobot.exe". This will take up to 3 parameters. First parameter is the maximum number of
URLs (this can be up to 100 million), 2nd and 3rd are starting and ending shard-number. The database is organized into
several shards or chunks. The default is 128 shards. This can be changed by changing two constants in the source-code
and recompiling, but you will probably never need to do this. 128 should work just fine.</p>

<p>The starting and ending numbers are there so that you can give the crawler smaller, clearly defined pieces to work
with. For the first test you can ignore this. So enter this command:</p>

<p><strong>PrepareRobot 10000000</strong></p>

<p>(that's 10 million, plenty enough for now)</p>

<p>This will take a few seconds or up to about a minute at this point. Once you have several hundred million URLs in the
database, this could easily take about an hour though.</p>

<p>Ok, before the next step you will need to open a second command-prompt. This one will be used to run the parser-loop.
Change to your install-directory and start "parse.bat". This will run parser.exe again and again in an endless loop.</p>

<p>In your first command-prompt start "robot.exe". Depending on the number of URLs to crawl the startup of robot.exe
can take up to a minute or two. With only 1 million URLs it should only take a few seconds.</p>

<p>The window of robot.exe will show you some information about how fast it is crawling and – very importantly – it will
let you change how many connections it should run simultaneously. Now this is actually a danger point. If you are
running this test over a DSL or cable connection, then you should NOT go beyond 100 connections. Some ISPs set a
limit for how many half-open connections you can have, and going beyond 100 connections could easily make you reach
that limit. If you are running your test on a dedicated server with a fast internet connection, then you can easily
use more than 1000 connections. You will have to experiment with this. Note that this will also depend on where
you are in the crawl. At the beginning of a crawl the crawler is very busy doing all the DNS lookups, so you may need
to use a lower connection-limit then, compared to later in the crawl.</p>

<p>Anyway, while the robot starts up (or very shortly thereafter) you should start "openacoon.bat" again, so that it can
handle all the data-processing.</p>

<p>Note: I'm usually running this software on a server with a quad-core 3.2GHz CPU, 32gb RAM, and a 1gbit/s
internet-connection. The limit for this machine is a crawl at about 1000 pages/s and 400mbit/s of incoming bandwidth.</p>

<p>When you want to end the robot, set the connection-limit to 0 and wait a bit for it to finish all the work. Then you
can quit the robot. You should then wait a few seconds more for parse.bat, so that it can process all the incoming data.
And yet wait another bit for openacoon.bat to finish processing the data. Quit openacoon.bat at some point when you see
it counting down from 5 to 0. Remember to NEVER abort openacoon.bat at some other point.</p>

<p>You can now begin another PrepareRobot / Robot / OpenAcoon.bat loop, or you can generate your first search-index. Here's
how to build an index: Simply start Gendb.exe from the command-prompt. With a very small amount of WWW-pages this will
only take about a minute or two. With larger amounts of data you should expect it to be on the order of one hour per 40 million pages.</p>

<p>Note that GenDb.exe will create some temp files that it will NOT clear up when done. It keeps these more or less for
debugging-purposes. Before you can make another GenDb-run you will need to delete gendb.progress and everything in the 
data\tmp directory.</p>

<p>Once the index is generated, start SearchServer.exe. The first time you do this you will probably see an alert from your
firewall as the SearchServer will need to listen on port 8081. Set your firewall to allow this.</p>

<p>Open your web-browser and enter the following URL:</p>

<p><strong>http://127.0.0.1:8081/query.html?startwith=1&q=[keyword]</strong></p>

<p>Use a keyword (or more than one) of your choice of course. What you will then see in the browser will look a little
weird at first. Take a look at the source of that page to get a clearer view. This format is not meant for an end-user,
but rather for a script on your own website, which should then format it in a... well... more human-readable way. :)</p>

<p>Ok, ok... I know that this short introduction was probably WAY too short. It does contain all the necessary steps for
you to get a search-index up-and-running, but it doesn't go deeply into what is actually going on. There is also some
stuff that I left out that will become important when you REALLY try to push the software to its limits. One tip: Do
NOT use your provider's DNS-server for a big and fast crawl. They would hate you for this. :)</p>

<p>Another useful tip: Disable your antivirus for the "data\crawler" subdirectory. You will be crawling a <strong>lot</strong>
of pages, so some of them <strong>will</strong> have bad things on them. Plus, having antivirus check these files will
<strong>REALLY</strong> slow things down.</p>
